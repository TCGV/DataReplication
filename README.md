# DataReplication
Study of the effect of graph topologies in data replication

## Details
Graph theory is extensively studied, experimented on and applied to communications networks ðŸ“¡. Depending on a communication networkâ€™s requirements it may benefit from adopting one or another network topology: Point to point, Ring, Star, Tree, Mesh, and so forth.

In this repository I analyze a network topology based on unweighted random regular graphs, and evaluate its robustness for data replication amid partial network disruption.

Take a look at the [GraphTests.cs](https://github.com/TCGV/DataReplication/blob/master/Tcgv.DataReplicationTests/DataModel/GraphTests.cs) and [RandomRegularGraphBuilderTests.cs](https://github.com/TCGV/DataReplication/blob/master/Tcgv.DataReplicationTests/Builders/RandomRegularGraphBuilderTests.cs) classes to get started.
